                    <h2>About Myself</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented professional 
                        with an MS in Computer Science from the New York Institute
                        of Technology and a BS in Applied Mathematics from CUNY City College. 
                        As a skilled software engineer with a strong foundation in data analysis
                        and machine learning, I have consistently demonstrated my ability 
                        to tackle complex technical challenges and deliver innovative solutions. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My experience spans across various projects, including the development 
                        of advanced machine learning models for the clustering and quality 
                        assessment of steel images, and the implementation of efficient 
                        image segmentation techniques. I have a proven track record of 
                        leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as TensorFlow and 
                        VGG19 for feature extraction, as well as employing clustering 
                        algorithms like K-means and PCA for data dimensionality 
                        reduction and analysis.
        
                        Additionally, I have worked with a variety of machine learning 
                        algorithms, including naive bayes classifiers, decision trees, 
                        random forests, linear regression, and various algorithms for 
                        unlabeled data to develop predictive models and enhance 
                        data-driven decision-making processes.
